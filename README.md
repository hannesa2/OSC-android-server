# Android OSC server

A simple Android app that can send and receive OSC messages.

On the OSC Sender page currently there is a buttons card and custom card, but it can be expanded to add any kind of OSC message type that is needed. The OSC Receiver page logs the date/time a message was received and what the message was. Finally, there is a settings page to allow for input of the IP Address and in/out ports.
